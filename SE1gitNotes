github cycle of updating files for repositories

add > commit > push

git add .
. = all files but you can name the file as well

git commit -m ""
-m adds a quick message to the commit rather than opening another screen

git push

pushes to github itself

git reflog is how you view the history to the repositories

git checkout -b <branch-name>

-b adds a branch
<branch-name> is the literal branch you would like to create
